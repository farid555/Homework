**SCRIBE (Markup Language)**
**[Scribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(markup_language))** is a markup language and [word processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) system that pioneered the use of [descriptive markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). Scribe was revolutinonary when it was procesed, because it involved for the first time a clean separation of presentation and content.

**Scribe** was designed and developed by Brian Reid of Carnegie Mellon University. It formed the subject of his 1980 doctoral dissertation, for which he received the Association for computing Machinery's Grace Murray Hopper **Award in 1982.**
